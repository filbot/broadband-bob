My internet connection is not the best but it's usually within the "range" that I pay for, however, from time to time, it drops below that range. I decided to utilize a RaspberryPi I had laying around and configure it to run speed tests every 15min. If the download speed was below the range I pay for, fire off a tweet to my service provider's Twitter account that is specificly setup to deal with customer complaints. 

### Results

### Acknowledgments
This project was inspired heavily, and by that I mean, 90% of the code used is from Reddit users [AlekseyP's](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlekseyP) own [project](https://redd.it/43fi39) where he tweets at his ISP for not providing the bandwidth that he paid for.
